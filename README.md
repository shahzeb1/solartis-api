# Solartis PHP (Laravel) Insurance API

I have gone ahead and put together an easy to use PHP API (designed for the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework) for [Solartis](https://www.solartis.com/) travel insurance API.

### Instructions:

- Make sure you have the curl library in your composer.json file: `"ixudra/curl": "^6.16"`
- Place the `Solartis.php` from the `lib/` folder into your Controller folder.
- Refer to the test file in the `test/` folder to see how various aspects of the API are called.
